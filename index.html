	<p>Hi my name is Manuel I <strong>love</strong> comics, video Games, and movies. A little bit about me... I was born January 14th
	1996 In Albuquerque NM. As I grew up I got to know more people and meet new friends. But when I was young I loved
	video games! My first ever game console was a game boy. Played games like Bomber Man, Mario, etc. And as time went
	bye I got to play PS2 games like Ratchet and Clank, Sly Cooper, Jak and Daxter, War of the Monsters, etc.</p>
