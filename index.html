	<p>Hi my name is Manuel I <strong>love</strong> comics, video Games, and Movies. A little bit about me... I was born January 14th
	1996 In Albuquerque NM. As i grew up i got to know more people and meet new friends. But when i ws young i loved
	video games! My first ever game console was a game boy. Played games like Bomber Man, Mario, etc. And as time went
	bye i got to play PS2 games like Ratchet and Clank, Sly cooper, Jak and Daxter, War of the monsters, etc.</p>
