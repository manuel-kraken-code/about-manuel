	<p>Hi my name is Manuel I love comics, video Games, and Movies. A little bit about me... I was born January 14th
	1996 In Albuquerque NM. As i grew up i got to know more people and meet new friends. But when i ws young i loved
	video games! My first ever game console was a game boy. Played games like Bomber Man, Mario, etc. And as time went
	bye i got to play PS2 games like Ratchet and Clank, Sly cooper, Jak and Daxter, War of the monsters, etc.</p>
				<h2>Online Identity</h2>
				<p>So what I saw for my internet search was nothing but Pablo Escobar and
					facebook manuel's on there site. Glad i didn't see myself on there. I
					have never liked being stocked online. I only like family and friends
					see what i do.</p>
